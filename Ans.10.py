# Is indentation optional in Python?

name=str(input("Enter your name: "))
if name=="Govind":
  print("Hii, Govind")
  print("How are you")
else:
  print("Who are you")
  print("Why are you here ?")
print("Thanks")

# Explanation:
'''
1. now the statement if name=="Govind": is true so it executes
the body if  with the "Thanks" 
2. if, if statement is being false then compiler skip this and print
else statement. with the "Thanks"
